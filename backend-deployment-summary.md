# Backend Deployment Summary

## Current Status
The backend has been deployed to AWS ECS but is experiencing startup issues. The application starts but then fails after initialization.

## Deployment Details

### Infrastructure
- **ECS Cluster**: sabpaisa-tokenization-cluster
- **ECS Service**: backend-service-final
- **Task Definition**: backend-final:1
- **Container**: Running on Fargate with 512 CPU and 1024 Memory
- **Security Group**: Allows all inbound traffic on all ports

### Current Task Status
- **Status**: RUNNING (but application failing internally)
- **Public IP**: Changes with each restart (last was 65.0.199.176)

### Known Issues
1. The application starts but encounters errors during initialization
2. H2 database warnings about duplicate indexes (non-critical)
3. The health endpoint is not responding

## Access Information

### CloudWatch Logs
- **Log Group**: `/ecs/backend-final`
- **Console URL**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=ap-south-1#logStream:group=/ecs/backend-final

### ECS Service Console
- **URL**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=ap-south-1#/clusters/sabpaisa-tokenization-cluster/services/backend-service-final/tasks

### Expected Endpoints (when working)
- Health Check: `http://<PUBLIC_IP>:8082/actuator/health`
- Swagger UI: `http://<PUBLIC_IP>:8082/swagger-ui.html`
- API Docs: `http://<PUBLIC_IP>:8082/v3/api-docs`
- H2 Console: `http://<PUBLIC_IP>:8082/h2-console`

## Next Steps

To troubleshoot the backend deployment:

1. **Check CloudWatch Logs**: 
   - Go to the CloudWatch console link above
   - Look for the complete error stack trace
   - The logs will show why the application is failing to start

2. **Common Issues to Check**:
   - Missing environment variables
   - Database connectivity issues
   - Port binding conflicts
   - Memory/resource constraints

3. **Quick Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Get current task status
   aws ecs describe-services --cluster sabpaisa-tokenization-cluster --services backend-service-final --region ap-south-1

   # Get logs
   aws logs tail /ecs/backend-final --since 10m --region ap-south-1

   # Get running task details
   TASK_ARN=$(aws ecs list-tasks --cluster sabpaisa-tokenization-cluster --service-name backend-service-final --region ap-south-1 --query 'taskArns[0]' --output text)
   aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster sabpaisa-tokenization-cluster --tasks $TASK_ARN --region ap-south-1
   ```

## Pipeline Status
The backend deployment pipeline has been successfully created and pushed to GitHub. It follows the same phased approach as the frontend:
- Phase 1: Infrastructure Discovery
- Phase 2: Docker Build and Push
- Phase 3: Network Resources Creation
- Phase 4: ECS Service Deployment

The pipeline can be triggered from GitHub Actions when ready.
